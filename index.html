                        <p>In our group's presentation on the characteristics of a 21st century assessment, we delved into the roles of assessments plays during classroom sessions. We examined how assessments serve not only as measures of student's performance but also as an invaluable tool for guiding instruction. During the discussion, we discovered the importance of aligning assessments with capabilities of the students to ensure that they effectively evaluate and absorb the lesson. Moreover, we explored various assessment methods, including formative, summative, and authentic assessments, highlighting their unique contributions to the over-all learning process. In conclusion, we were able to emphasize the critical need for educators to thoughtfully integrate assessments into the teaching practices to promote meaningful learning outcomes and student success.</p>

                        <p>Studying dragons and drawing them has been a captivating journey. Delving into the lore and mythology surrounding these mythical creatures has offered insights into various cultures and their beliefs. Additionally, researching dragon anatomy, behavior, and symbolism has deepened our appreciation for the rich tapestry of human imagination. On the artistic front, drawing dragons has been both challenging and rewarding. From sketching their majestic forms to adding intricate details like scales and wings, each stroke of the pencil has been an exercise in creativity and craftsmanship. It has not only expanded our knowledge and skills but also sparked my curiosity to continue exploring the fantastical realms where dragons roam. Also we had fun collaborating in discussing our topic showcasing to our classmate our skills. We had fun and importantly we identify that dragons have different personality and looks and all of the things we learn are all shared with our classmate.</p>

                        <p>Incorporating a drawing activity focused on illustrating how Roald Dahl portrays Mr. Fox's intelligence adds a creative dimension to the assessment. Through the detailed assessment list, we were abel to not just visually represent key scenes or moments that highlight Mr. Fox's wit and resourcefulness but also assess if we follow and adhere to the assessment items in the list. This exercise encouraged us to have deeper engagement with the text, fostering critical thinking skills and artistic expression.</p>

                            These are just some of the group's side comments as they did the lesson plan for the story The Giving Tree. It could be said that at first they were challenged, good thing that prior to the making per se, its parts have been discussed already which made it less harder for the group to craft one. The task was divides based off where each member excelled in, resulting to a smooth collaboration among the members. However, the first lesson plan made had loopholes which needed to be improved. Nonetheless, the feedback given during the initial presentation of the lesson plan really helped the group to improve it better, and they were able to do it best, thus getting a hundred points for it.</p>

Overall, there wasn't really much to revise and it's commendable how each member was really open to suggestions and improving the output as instructed. In the end, the group believes that they have done a great job even during the demonstration as they gave it their all and it paid off not only because of the high score they got but also for the lessons, knowledge, and skills they have acquired which they can use for when they become professionals themselves.</p>
